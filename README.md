## Projects I'm Proud Of  
- **[ROS1 Gazebo Hector Multi-Drone Simulation](https://github.com/shirbenami/ROS1-Gazebo)** — Developed a simulation for multiple Hector Quadrotor drones in Gazebo with ROS. Includes integration with ORB-SLAM3/COVINS for collaborative SLAM, plus real-time visual inter-drone detection (color detection and template matching) and azimuth sharing.
  
- **[SSL ResNet Feature Extractor](https://github.com/shirbenami/SSL-SimCLR-ResNet)** – Built and trained a ResNet50 model using self-supervised learning to improve feature extraction.
  
- **[SSL YOLO SimCLR](https://github.com/shirbenami/SSL-YOLOv8)** – This project explores the integration of YOLOv8 with SimCLR for self-supervised representation learning, followed by fine-tuning on a labeled dataset.
  
- **[DeepStream-YOLO](https://github.com/shirbenami/DeepStream-YOLO)** – Implemented object detection on yolo model vehicles with deepstream pipeline.
